This project is about dynamic memory allocation.
We can allocate memory at runtime using malloc, calloc and realloc.
After we've achieved our purpose we then free the memory and return
it to the OS. We use free() function.
When we allocate memory using malloc, malloc return a pointer to the
allocated memory.
