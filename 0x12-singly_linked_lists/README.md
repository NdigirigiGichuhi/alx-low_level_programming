This project is about linked list.
Linked list consists of nodes connected together to make sort of a chain.
The node are connected together by a pointer that holds the adress of the
next node.
The node starts with a start pointer which is the head of the lists.
To create a node you have to have a structure and allocate memory to the
structure using malloc.
